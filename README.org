* Emacs bindings for Tridactyl
Starting point for customizing Tridactyl to mimic Emacs

** Installation
Install [[https://github.com/tridactyl/tridactyl][Tridactyl]], set up [[https://github.com/tridactyl/tridactyl#extra-features][native messenger]], then fix [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/aupgmd/firefox_key_fixes_for_emacs_users][Ctrl-N issue]]. Copy emacs_bindings to ~/.config/tirdactyl and add 
#+begin_src 
source ~/.config/tridactyl/emacs_bindings
#+end_src
to your tridactylrc, or just copy bindings into it. 

** Contributions
Are welcome! I thinking of these bindings as a base to someone's own customization, but if I missed some common default binding, or some nice trick - please open PR/issue!
